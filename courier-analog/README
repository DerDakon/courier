The courier-analog script generates log summaries for the Courier mail server.

Courier-analog generates log summaries for incoming and outgoing SMTP
connections, and IMAP and POP3 activity.  courier-analog can generate output
in text or HTML format.

Courier-analog requires the Date::Calc Perl module.
See the installed manual page for usage instructions.

rpm and deb packages
====================

These are not the same packages as the ones from the distributions'
repositories. They carry an internal higher revision level in order to
prevent them from getting upgraded by the distributions' packaging. This
packaging exists in order to have a convenient way of updating after a
release without waiting for the distribution's packages to get built.

Installation
============

rpm
===

It is not necessary to unpack this tarball in order to build this tarball.

Run "dnf install rpm-build", if it's not installed already, then:

$ rpmbuild -ta courier-analog-VERSION.tar.bz2

If this fails due to any missing dependencies, install them.

This creates courier-analog-VERSION.noarch.rpm and
courier-analog-VERSION.src.rpm, then install the noarch.rpm with 'rpm -U'.

deb
===

Run "apt install devscripts debhelper", if they're not installed already.
Create an empty directory, and copy/move the tarball into it:

$ mkdir tmp
$ cp courier-analog-VERSION.tar.bz2 tmp
$ cd tmp

Unpack the tarball and cd into the unpacked subdirectory:

$ tar xjvf courier-analog-VERSION.tar.bz2
$ cd courier-analog-VERSION

Run the courier-debuild script. Its parameters get forwarded to debuild.

$ ./courier-debuild -us -uc

NOTE: the above steps must be followed strictly. The courier-debuild script
expects the distributed tarball in its parent directory.

The deb subdirectory now contains a "courier-analog_<VERSION_all.deb" file
that can be installed with "dpkg -i".

See INSTALL for manual installation instructions.
